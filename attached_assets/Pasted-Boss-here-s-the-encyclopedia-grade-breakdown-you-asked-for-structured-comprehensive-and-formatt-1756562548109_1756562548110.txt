	3.	DFS Law and Regulatory Integration
	•	Approximately 7.8 hours (≈13% of the exam) focus exclusively on Florida’s Department of Financial Services, licensing standards, and agent responsibilities.

	•	[Define] → terminology explanation.
	•	[Contrast] / [Compare] → side-by-side policy analysis.
	•	[Discuss] → applied reasoning in insurance law or ethics.
