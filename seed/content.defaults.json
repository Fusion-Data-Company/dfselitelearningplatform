This restriction is fundamental to the managed care model and directly impacts both provider compensation and subscriber cost exposure.\n\n**Balance Billing:** The practice of billing a patient for the difference between the provider's charged amount and the amount paid by the insurance plan. This practice is prohibited for in-network HMO providers.\n\nHMO providers agree to accept the plan's pre-negotiated rates as payment in full for covered services. Subscribers are only responsible for their designated cost-sharing amounts (copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles) as specified in their benefit structure.\n\n## Primary Care Physician (PCP) Role\n\nThe PCP serves as the gatekeeper in the HMO model, coordinating care and managing referrals to specialists. This systematic approach helps control costs while ensuring appropriate utilization of healthcare services."
